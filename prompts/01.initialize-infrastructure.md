**Role:** Senior DevOps & Technical Lead
**Task:** Scaffold a pristine development environment for a C# Backend Project ("SpaceTruckers").

**Context:** We are building a backend for "The Great Galactic Delivery Race." As the Tech Lead, I need to enforce high standards for documentation, testing, and CI/CD immediately.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Directory Structure:**
    * Generate an empty .Net 10 solution following Clean Architecture and ensure this folder structure:
        * `src/SpaceTruckers.Domain`
        * `src/SpaceTruckers.Application`
        * `src/SpaceTruckers.Infrastructure`
        * `src/SpaceTruckers.Api`
        * `tests/SpaceTruckers.UnitTests`
        * `tests/SpaceTruckers.IntegrationTests`
        * `docs/` (for documentation)
        * `docs/domain/` (For Ubiquitous Language)
        * `docs/structurizr/adrs` (for Architecture Decision Records)
        * `docs/structurizr` (for C4 models)

2. **Tooling & Configuration:**
    * Create a `Directory.Build.props` file to enforce:
        * Latest C# language version.
        * Nullable reference types enabled (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`).
        * `TreatWarningsAsErrors` set to `true`.
    * Create a `.editorconfig` enforcing standard C# coding styles.

3.  **Structurizr Setup:**
    * Generate a `docs/structurizr/workspace.dsl` file. 
    * It should be pre-configured to support C4 views (System Context, Container).
    * Populate it with a basic "System Context" view skeleton (Software System: "Galactic Delivery System", User: "Operations Manager").
    * Ensure the DSL is configured to render ADRs if placed in the `docs/structurizr/adrs` folder.
    * Include a basic script to run Structurizr Lite locally (via Docker).

4.  **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**
    * Generate a `.github/workflows/build-and-test.yaml` file.
    * **Stages:**
        1.  **Build:** Restore and build the solution.
        2.  **Lint:** Run `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`.
        3.  **Test:** Run all unit and integration tests.
        4.  **Quality:** Integrate SonarCloud analysis (assume secrets `SONAR_TOKEN` and `SONAR_ORG` exist).
        5.  **Architecture Check:** (Optional) Verify that `structurizr` files are valid.

5. **SonarQube:**
    * Create a `sonar-project.properties` file in the root with appropriate placeholders for Project Key and Organization.

5.  **Documentation:**
    * Generate a `README.md` that serves as the "Developer Guide."
    * Include clear instructions on:
        * Prerequisites (Docker, .NET SDK).
        * How to spin up the environment.
        * How to run the architecture viewer (Structurizr).
        * How to run tests with coverage reports.
        * How to run sonarqube locally with Docker

**Output:** Provide the scripts and file contents in code blocks. Ensure the GitHub Action uses specific, pinned versions for actions to ensure stability.
