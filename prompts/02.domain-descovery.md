**Role:** Domain Architect & QA Lead
**Task:** Analyse the "SpaceTruckers" requirements and define the Ubiquitous Language and Acceptance Criteria.

**Input Data:** 
Welcome to SpaceTruckers Inc., the fastest growing interplanetary delivery service in the galaxy.
Our fleet moves cargo between planets, moons, and space stations. Each delivery involves skilled drivers, unique vehicles, and complex routes across dangerous space lanes.
We'd like you to design and build a backend system that helps us run "The Great Galactic Delivery Race."

What's Going On?
Every delivery in our universe has a few key ingredients:
• Driver – the fearless pilot in charge of the vehicle
• Vehicle – anything from a HoverTruck to a RocketVan or SpaceCycle
• Route – a journey from an origin to a destination, often with checkpoints along the way
• Events – things that happen during the trip: starting the route, reaching checkpoints, completing deliveries, or dealing with unexpected incidents

Space is not a calm place. Asteroid fields, cosmic storms, emergency maintenance, and other surprises can happen at any time during a delivery. Operations needs a clear, reliable way to see what's going on and how each trip is progressing.

Your Mission
Create a backend application in C# that can:
• Manage basic information about drivers, vehicles, and routes
• Create and track deliveries (trips) as they move through their routes
• Record events that occur during a delivery
• Produce a useful summary once a trip is complete

The system should support multiple deliveries happening at the same time and give us a clear sense of what happened during each trip, including any "interesting" moments along the way.

Hints About What We Care About

we value solutions that:

• Use event-driven ideas to handle and react to trip events
• Reflect domain-driven thinking in how the core concepts (drivers, vehicles, routes, events, trips) are modelled
• Are supported by tests (ideally written in a test-first or test-friendly way)
• Follow clean architecture principles that separate domain logic from technical details
• Apply clean code and SOLID principles so the code is readable, maintainable, and easy to reason about
• Are loosely coupled, making it easier to extend or swap out parts over time
• Show awareness of concurrency when multiple trips are active at once

**Objectives:**

1. **Ubiquitous Language (`docs/domain/ubiquitous-language.md`):**
    * Create a glossary of terms. Define them strictly to avoid ambiguity.
        - *Example:* Define exactly what constitutes a "Trip" vs a "Route".
        - *Example:* Define "Incident" and "Checkpoint".

2.  **Update Structurizr DSL:**
    * Update the `docs/structurizr/workspace.dsl` to include the Core Domain terms: `Driver`, `Vehicle`, `Route`, `Trip`, `Incident`, `Checkpoint`, `GalacticRace`.
    * Define relationships between them clearly in the DSL.

3.  **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
    * Generate `tests/acceptance/features/*.feature` files. Write scenarios for the "Happy Path" (Starting a trip, Reaching a checkpoint, Completing a delivery). For example,
        - `trip_creation.feature`:
            - Scenario: Successful trip creation with valid resources.
            - Scenario: Failure when assigning an unavailable Driver or Vehicle.
        - `trip_progress.feature`:
            - Scenario: Successfully recording a checkpoint arrival.
            - Scenario: Recording a "Catastrophic" incident that aborts the trip.
    * **Crucial:** Write scenarios for:
        * **Concurrency:** "Two dispatchers try to assign the same Driver or Vehicle to *different* trips simultaneously." (Expected: Optimistic Concurrency Exception)
        * **Invariants:** "Attempting to start a trip with a vehicle that has insufficient cargo capacity."
        * **Race Conditions:** "An incident is reported on a Trip that has just been marked Completed."

4.  **Edge Case Analysis:**
    * Provide a bulleted list of "Architectural Risks & Edge Cases" that the implementation must handle.
    * Specifically address:
        * **Resource Locking:** How we prevent a vehicle from being double-booked.
        * **Idempotency:** What happens if the 'Start Trip' event is received twice?
        * **Temporal Anomalies:** Handling events that arrive out of order (e.g., 'TripCompleted' arrives before 'CheckpointReached').

**Output:**
Provide the updated Structurizr DSL content, the Gherkin feature files, and the Architectural Risk Analysis.
Provide the full markdown content for the files above. Do not write C# code yet; focus purely on the behavioral specifications.
